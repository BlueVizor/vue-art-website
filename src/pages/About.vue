            <p>I grew up in the Nebraska countryside with three older brothers. Being surrounded by nature gave me a plethora of opportunities to observe from life and draw. The itch to create never faded, and art continues to be a crucial part of my life.</p>
            <p>In my work, I most enjoy creating animal portraits. I attempt to create an emotion between the subject and the audience through use of color and body language that is portrayed in my pieces. While I mostly engage in the use of acrylic paint, I enjoy exploring various other mediums.</p>
